# Dice Garden

Dice Garden is a completely open-source & vanilla JavaScript Dice-Roller. The entire project has been built as part of a school project.

The Dice Garden features a landing page that includes on-load animations, up to 3 dices that are rendered in 3D by CSS processing, and a navigation bar that packs a language change feature.
You will also find inside the website a part that allows you to roll challenges using the random mechanic, and right below you will find the "Mega Dice", that pushes further this same mechanic.
